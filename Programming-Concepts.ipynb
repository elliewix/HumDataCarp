    "\n",
    "The Anaconda package will install Python and other helper packages.  It'll also place in some hooks/aliases in your computer to make working with Python easier (particularly for Windows users).  You will not directly interact with Anaconda.  You will use PyCharm to write and execute your scripts, but have it hooked to your Anaconda installation.  We'll walk you through this.\n",

Choose the one that has Python 3.6.x _Do not choose one that states Python 2.6 or 2.7_. You may need to click the ‚Ä¶ button and manually add where your ~/anaconda/bin/python exists.  \n",

Python (at least in everyday use) only requires programmers to deal with two numerical datatypes. Why would we need more than one way to store numbers in the first place?\n",
    "\n",
    "This has to do with the legacy of early computing and how computers store data in memory. The key fact is that storing some kinds of numbers takes up less memory than other types of numbers. With 64 units of memory space, practically any number can be stored. However, not all numbers need that much space. The vast majority of numbers only need 16 units of memory space.\n",

    "Recall our earlier discussion about how early computer languages were closer to the computer's internal structure. When memory was very limited and expensive, allowing a number to take up more memory than necessary could render a project impossible from an engineering or budgetary perspective. Programmers gained a real benefit from the variety of numerical data types that allowed them fine control over how much memory to allocate for each number they needed to store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the early days of computing, the amount of memory available in today's computers is incredibly huge and cheap (though not infinite!) Programmers can afford to be more relaxed when it comes to managing memory. Python is also better than early languages at automatically deciding how much memory is needed to store a given number and so takes care of much of this in the background for us.
