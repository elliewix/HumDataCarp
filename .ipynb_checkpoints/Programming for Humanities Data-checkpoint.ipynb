    "\n",
    "Humanities work can take many many forms, but usually involves text.  This text may be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* derivatives from text, e.g. bag of words\n",
    "* transcriptions of intererviews\n",
    "* unstructured free text\n",
    "* semi-strucutred data\n",
    "* qualitative coded values\n",
    "* lists of resources\n",
    "* and many more\n",
    "\n",
    "The data area where Python really shines is the manipulation of text structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## But what about R?\n",
    "\n",
    "R is another language, focused on statistics.  It has great support for modeling, viz, etc.  Many text modeling/analysis tools are written in R.  So you may need to focus your efforts in learning R.  That said, the basic concepts that we're covered this morning and will look at this afternoon will carry over to working in R.  The structures in R are a bit different, so it isn't 1:1, but knowing the concept of a variable, the concept of a string, the concept of numerical types, etc. will serve you very well in the transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## You don't have to choose just one platform\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right tool for the right job is a key concept for programming.  Sometimes an entirely different language can save your a lot of trouble.  Also, the digital humanities crowd is pretty split between R and Python, so being functional in both will serve you well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python handles un-/semi-structured data very well, so you might find it easier to wrangle all your raw data in Python, then produce your analysis data file for processing in another program (e.g. produce coordinates for ArcGIS, network data for Gephi, categorical codes for R, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to pick and work with only one program.  You'll want to use many tools.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this problem we'll explore reading in text, manipulating it to get our data out, and then writing out data for ourselves.  Writing programs is a very iterative and non-linear process.  Much like starting off with an outline of a paper, you'll have clearer ideas on how to handle certain tasks that others.\n",

    "# Reading in text\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple methods of reading in text, but I'm going to show you one of the classic methods.  We're very used to programs handling file opening, writing, editing, etc. for us, but when it comes to programming languages, we have to do that all ourselves.  We're used to opening and closing files within a GUI, but we'll be doing that more explicitly inside of our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "`variable = open(filename, mode)` is our basic pattern for file handling.  The filename is just a string of the file path, and the mode is a string (https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#open) to declare which mode you'd like to oepn the file as.  There are many, but you're going to usually use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'r' for reading in a file\n",
    "* 'w' for writing to a file\n",
    "* 'a' for append (not the most common)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're done doing what you need to a file, you'll want to run:  `variable.close()`.  Once you close a file you will no longer have read or write access to that IO object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more specific pattern for handling files is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a file IO object in the desired mode\n",
    "    * `file_in = open('raven.txt', 'r')`\n",
    "    * `file_out = open('raven_data.txt', 'w')`\n",
    "    * When writing out a file, if that file name does not exist it will create it.  If it does exist, in `'w'` mode it'll overwrite it, and `'a'` mode will add stuff to the end of it. \n",
    "2. Do your stuff to the file\n",
    "    * We haven't learned these yet!\n",
    "3. Close the file\n",
