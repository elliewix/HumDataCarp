    "So you're curious about Python but new to programming and unsure how it might help you in your research.  A great place to start!  This lesson is designed to be a 2 hour hands on tour of how Python can be used as a utility for processing text, particularly for humanities/literature projects.  Two hors isn't sufficient to give you every essential piece of knowledge, but it is enough time to better understand if it might be something useful to keep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we're going to dive right in and explore the basics as we're going.  Expect to not understand every piece of code you see here, and get comfortable with that.  Remember that we're going for a tour here rather than full tutorial.  You'd rather not invest days into learning Python only to realize that it isn't something useful for your projects, right?  But two hours is enough to explore some of the patterns and get some tools."
