Materials for Spring 2017 Humanities Data Programming workshop.  This should run as a one day intensive overview of Python for pure beginners.

These materials aren't meant to be the only instruction in Python, but comprise a starting point for someone curious about how it looks and what they might do with it.

The examples are entirely based on text processing.

* Morning session:  Programming-Concepts.ipynb
  * This session covers some of the essential data types and Python syntax.  Again, aiming at exposure and demonstration rather than instruction in theory.
* Programming for Humanities Data.ipynb
  * This session walks students through a single, but complex task. The idea is to create a bag of words from within The Raven. Students are walked through the steps of lowercasing the text, removing punctionation, splitting words, and removing stop words.  Ending with an easy method of counting and exploring the words and writing out the data file with the CSV.
  * This session could stand alone from the morning session if the students were previously exposed to core programming concepts or perhaps already versed in R.  This aims at walking students through the iterative development process of trying to solve a complex text processing problem.  It also provides foundational patterns for reading in data, manipulating text, and writing out data.
