    "We're going to be installing several things that will give you a standard Python development envirionment, but use applications on top of it that are suitable for beginners.  This means you're set for exploration and experimentation, but you'll have something that will be appropriate if you continue on.\n",

    "## Step 1: Download and install this stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "* Download and install the Python 3.6 graphical installer of Anaconda from here: https://www.continuum.io/downloads\n",
    "* Download and install the PyCharm Education Edition:  https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/download\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda package will install Python and other helper packages.  It'll also place in some hooks/aliases in your computer to make working with Python easier (particularly for Windows users).  You will not directly interact with Anaconda.  You will use PyCharm to write and execute your scripts, but have it hooked to your Anaconda installation.  We'll walk you through this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Test Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "After Anaconda has finished installing, restart your computer.  Now we’ll test that everything worked.  You’ll be using anaconda the entire class, but it’ll be somewhat invisible to you.\n",

    "**Open your command line**\n",

    "**Attempt to launch Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Within your command line application, type in ‘python’ (without quotes) and press return.  \n",

    "* Mac users:  it should state it is Python 3.6 and not Python 2.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put up your help flag and halt progress here if you hit either error condition.  Otherwise, just close the window after this.  Everything has worked and you can move on to installing PyCharm Education edition.\n",

    "        * For mac users, you might see several.  You want the one that has anaconda in the file path.  E.g. ~/anaconda/bin/python.  Choose the one that has Python 3.6.x _Do not choose one that states Python 2.6 or 2.7_. You may need to click the … button and manually add where your ~/anaconda/bin/python exists.  \n",

    "3. You’ll now see an empty file in the main part of the PyCharm window\n",
    "4. Type in the following into that screen: `print(\"Hello world\")`\n",
    "5. A green \"play\" arrow should appear next to line 1 next to that text.  It may take a moment or two for the green button to appear.  That is completely normal and just PyCharm connecting to your anaconda installation.\n",
    "6. Click that green button!\n",
    "7. A new panel at the bottom of the program should appear, with text that starts with \"Hello world\". \"Process finished with exit code 0\" means that everything worked and is not something to worry about.  Looks weird, though, I know.\n",

Python (at least in everyday use) only requires programmers to deal with two numerical datatypes. Why would we need more than one way to store numbers in the first place?\n",
    "\n",
    "This has to do with the legacy of early computing and how computers store data in memory. The key fact is that storing some kinds of numbers takes up less memory than other types of numbers. With 64 units of memory space, practically any number can be stored. However, not all numbers need that much space. The vast majority of numbers only need 16 units of memory space.\n",

    "Recall our earlier discussion about how early computer languages were closer to the computer's internal structure. When memory was very limited and expensive, allowing a number to take up more memory than necessary could render a project impossible from an engineering or budgetary perspective. Programmers gained a real benefit from the variety of numerical data types that allowed them fine control over how much memory to allocate for each number they needed to store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the early days of computing, the amount of memory available in today's computers is incredibly huge and cheap (though not infinite!) Programmers can afford to be more relaxed when it comes to managing memory. Python is also better than early languages at automatically deciding how much memory is needed to store a given number and so takes care of much of this in the background for us.
