My Dear Sir, 
I only received your favour of the 16th late last night, on my return from the Syro-Egyptian, or I would have answered before.  
I shall be very happy to meet Mr Wright at the Archaeological meeting this evening, the meeting of which society indeed, I have attended on the last occasion.

My dear Pettigrew,
On coming here, I have found your kind Note with its printed inclosure.  I thank you for both, but I should have been glad to have found you here in person.  I cannot call on you today, but I am desirous to assure you that I fully agree with our friend Mr Henry Ellis, that he & I ought not to mix ourselves up with either of the belligerent parties.  I am constitutionally a man of peace, and if I could assist in restoring that blessing, I would carry an olive branch to each of the Rival Camps, if I did not fear I should be drummed out of both.  I have great respect for Lord Albert Conyngham, and for many of your colleagues, as I also have for many of the staff on the other side.  I certainly shall not join them, but I am desirous that my name should be withdrawn from your committee, highly respectable, as it is, in its composition.  I sincerely hope that archaeological ??? will not interfere with the comforts of our antiquarian club, where I trust the word "archaeology" will not be even whispered.  "Oh no, we never mention it!", shall at least be my motto there.
With the kindest regard, 
I remain always, 
My dear Pettigrew, 
Yours most sincerely, 
Thomas Amyot

Atheneum, Tuesday

My dear Pettigrew,
"Yes", if it must be so.  But I really think you should not stick my name in so prominent a position.  I shall not be able to prepare a Reading, nor probably be able to be in Canterbury more than one day, or two days at most.  Since there are others, Mr James for instance, who would better fill up the printer's blank with literary & historical name.  My [...] at Somerset House alone gives one anything like a pretence for accepting the elevation you propose.  I presume my learned colleague will prepare a paper on the Battle of Bosworth.  I cannot so further back than the Battle of Antiquaries, when the Besiegers were led on by Sir Harry Nicolas, while I endeavoured to defend the Citadel with our Household Trophy.
Yours ever sincerely, 
Thomas Amyot.

My dear Pettigrew, 
According to Caley's request, I send you the copy which I received by the two penny post of the Manifesto of the beaten Herschelites.  I am surprised you have not received a presentation copy from the author.  The tone is so temperate, & the whole publication so harmless, that I do not think any answer from you is at all called for.  Pray let me have it again at your leisure, that I may keep with the other controversial effusions occasioned by the Royal nomination.
Yours ever sincerely, 
Thomas Amyot
I have just given an In-patients' letter to your protegee.

My dear Pettigrew,
Write me down an Egyptian.  If I can catch another, you shall book him too.  I hope when you set about filling your list, you will find "corn in Egypt".  Jon was much pleased with your lecture, but Harry was kept away by an engagement which I was not aware of.  
Yours ever,

My dear sir, 
I do with all my heart congratulate you on the result of this evenings' ballot at the Royal Society, in which I felt exceedingly interested, not only on your own personal account, but as the cause of truth and justice against calumny and malice.  Your answers to your vulgar-minded assailants are most convincing, and, to my knowledge, [...] they acquired no corroborative proofs, but had they stood in need of any commentary, an election under circumstances so trying, must have removed every pre-existing doubt.   Your triumph is, in every way, most complete! -

I must own that I was rather suspicious with regard to the Egyptian antiquity myself when I had compared the cartouches with three in a plate of the tablet of Abydos and some other authorities which I possess, but when I examined the object itself I could see not the slightest indications of [...] excepting that the figure of Horus was evidently added.  It is instead a most wonderful imitation it [...] I should have bought it without hesitation had I seen it for sale, though generally very cautious in examining antiquities previous to purchase.

My Dear Pettigrew
I have had a severe and unremitting diarrhea upon me ever since I returned, which commenced at Paris and remained until yesterday, which has greatly reduced me and rendered me very weak, and I much fear will prevent my being at Gloucester on Monday as I most anxiously wished to be.  My Medicus says I ought not to attempt it,  but if I get [...] I shall not be influenced much by that, as I think I can judge of my own capabilities better than any one, and if I feel myself equal to the undertaking you will see me as sure as the Angel of Darkness looks over Lincoln.  What this saying means is a good subject for an Archaeological Paper - does it infer that he takes no notice of that famous city?  That he overlooks it?  That he oversees with particular care?  That he hovers over it?  That he does not look into it?  Many other questions of the same order and category may be propounded, which able antiquaries may discuss if not puzzle themselves and the world with.  For my part I think his majesty looks into most large cities and smiles with ineffable delight on what he sees in them.  There can be no doubt but he was delighted at Gloucester when the glorious Protestant martyrs were burned there and will probably be present next week to say something in favour of medieval or primeval antiquities.  He is now at York but the Rail Roads will transport him with delight in a very short period of time if he require such assistance.  No doubt he prevented Mr Way from attending at York and was devilish glad to accomplish so great an object.  The ominous absence of the Secretary of the Institute suggests the idea of a new split, is he contriving a new society?  What will he call it?  I do not know?  Can you say?  This is a letter of queries but the worst for me is query if I shall not be prevented from attending?  I hope not.  Ever truly yours, 
W. Betham
Sir Thomas Deane is here and says he cannot be at Gloucester either.  What a vagabond.

My Dear Sir,

Your optimism regarding the respective merits of M. Champollion and Dr. Young shall meet with every attention.  As you have already greatly overpaid the value of my work even when completed, by the present of your beautiful book, I shall consider it a favour if you will permit me to put your name into my list of subscribers, with that of your friend Mr. Hudson Gurney.  I do not pretend to be disinterested in this, as I am aware that the respect with which your name is regarded as that of a profound and classical scholar, is likely to be of much advantage to my work.

As the Congress is not held until my season of lecture expires I had made up my mind to deny myself the pleasure of being amongst you.  Your letter enquiring whether I am to be there has however induced me to relax in some measure my resolutions.  If you think I can be of use to you I could make arrangements for being a single day or so at the meeting.  My book on the Roman Wall is at present absorbing all my attention, but having before I turned to this subject investigated with some care the structure of the Norman Castle in England I could without much difficulty be prepared with a popular lecture on that subject.  On these occasions it is desirable to provide light matter for the uninitiated as well as deep disquisitions for the learned.  I should chiefly keep in view those who had not thought much when antiquities with the view of showing them its importance and interest as the handmaid of history.  You will perhaps let me know if this proposal meets your approbation.  
I am dear sir
Yours faithfully

My dear sir, 
I have been from home examining two of the secondary stations of the Wall which are least accessible and which I had not visited before.  My Manchester paper was very hastily written (owing to the pressure of my engagements) and of course never intended for publication.  It was meant as a sort of popular address for such an audience as we had at Chester last year.  Such as it is it is at your service if it be of any use.  May I particularly request that the paper or the proofs may be read over by some one who will rectify any errors which in my haste I may have made.  I have got the cuts from my printer now but I am sorry to say that having lent some of those you wish for to the editor of the Cambrian Arch. Journal the parcel was lost on its way back to me.  Those which I have I will send by to nights mail.
I hope to get my book on the Wall out before Christmas, it was cost me a great deal of labour.  I am obliged to you for carrying the amount of my Congress ticket to my account subscription.
I am my dear sir
Yours faithfully

Sir, 
You have been misinformed, in regard to my having made any collections for a local history of Berks.  Some years ago, I undertook for my amusement and also with a view to publication, provided I was reimbursed all the necessary expenses, the genealogies of the County families founded on the visitations.  I found it was hopeless to imagine that I should be otherwise than very much out of pocket by giving my labour to the Public, and so, I have abandoned the pursuit.  A heavy domestic affliction has, for some time past, so thoroughly unnerved and dispririted me, that, beyond my ministerial duties, and providing for a very large family I have neither the time not the inclination for other matters.

I got your Note on Saturday too late to enable me to reply to it immediately, and my going out of town yesterday at an early hour precluded my seeing you.  
The late proceedings at the society are indeed disgraceful.  The perfect confidence that every one who knows you must have in your honour & integrity, would make them repel with disdain such contemptible charges.  My connexion with the society being founded entirely & solely on the opinion I had gained of it through yourself, I should consider myself guilty of great injustice towards you did I not join heartily the numerous body of your friends in withdrawing myself a society that was not forward to discountenance such conduct, by every means in their power

Pray let us discuss this Humphrey barrow question fully on Wednesday, and then we shall establish a barometer by which the new society can be understood.

I dine with Bland tomorrow at six, and will call on you in Saville Row at Four or a little earlier.  
I am ruralising for Vacation here in the midst of sloppy ways - not here voluntarily - but, like thousands more, have a house which I wish to let, and feel it might be kept aired at least a little till I find a tenant for it.

I cannot resist the desire I feel to write at once & thank you for the lucid and able manner in which you explained the fallacies of Mr Bruce last night at the Antiquaries; and for the manly attempt you made to save the Society's respectability, and prevent an act of mad suicide.  I am so sure that you took the strictly proper view of the question, that I feel bound to thank you for the trouble and exertion you voluntarily underwent and I am sure the Society is much indebted to you in thus doing your best to save that position, which they have now forever lost.  
I feel so strongly on this point that I cannot trust myself to say all that I feel on Mr Bruce's pamphlet, it is utterly illogical and inconclusive.  I could attach little value to a simple question, which requires 47 octavo pages to expound, it looks too much like special pleading, while his preface repudiates any claims "morally or justly" [...]

It would be improper in me to offer an opinion, without learning what your adversaries have to advance (as arguments) but you seen to have made out so strong a case and to have stated such facts concerning improper management of the affairs of the institution and such gross partiality in the selection of persons to advocate particular [...] that, unless the Governors, as a body, take the management with their own hands and act as an independent body, upon just & broad principles the Hospital must soon fall & all its prospective usefulness become lost to the public.

On my return to London on Friday evening I received your note and the interesting work which you have had the kindness to present to me, and its value is enhanced in my esteem, by the manner in which is has been presented to me.  You have however I think appreciated my services too highly; and I am gratified, if such as they have been, they have been of any use to you.  
I have not hitherto had leisure to read the whole of the work, but I value highly that which I have examined, and every page contains abundant proof of your labor and [...] and taste in the selection of the materials - also a great part of the matter is entirely new, and your own, and I consider it a most valuable addition to the stores of Egyptian literature.

I may presume, that in a country, where so great an interest is taken in every scientific undertaking, and particularly in archaeological researches, a great number of subscribers will contribute to the success of a work, which is expected to be of great use for the study of Egyptian antiquities.
If you should think it necessary to enter in correspondence with me upon this matter, or to send me the names of the subscribers directly, without the interference of a bookseller, I beg you to deliver the letters (*) at the residence of his Excell. the Ambassador of the Netherlands, 27 Bryanston Square.
At the first fascicules will be ready about the month of April, I should feel very glad to be informed of the names of the subscribers before that time.

I am at present a member of the Camden Society and have lately become a member of the Wiltshire Topographical Society, and I am now growing less willing to enter into societies than I was - I must therefore decline enrolling my name in another of the same, or of a similar kind, for I feel these calls upon my purse more bothersome than they used to be.
The book to which I alluded was half-bound 12.mo with my book plate pasted on the cover at the end were some M.S. corrections by the Editor, who appears to have been a Dissenting Minister and gave the copy to my grandfather.
I once sent some slight account of it to the Gentleman's Magazine, and likewise wrote to the editor the Athenaeum (Dr Aikin) describing it; this description I afterwards pasted in the volume
I have been trying to ascertain the exact title but am not sure that it is quite correct - it is mentioned in Cotton's Catalogue of Bibles &c but I cannot lay my hand upon my copy - I think it must have sent it to my son-in-law for I am unable to find it.

Dear Pettigrew,
I have waited hitherto in the anxious expectation of getting for you a Hereford Times paper, in which my inaugural address appeared.  But no premium on the original cost can procure one, as the whole impression (though enlarged on the occasion) was swept away at once.  King of the Herald's College has a copy that he would shew you, if you can contrive it, but the honor you intend me is not worth putting you to trouble to perform, though I am quite sensible of my obligation.  
The first lecture on the Histy. of England was to have appeared to day, but instead there is a postponement of a first portion to next Saturday.  If they send me from Hereford the number I have ordered, I shall have the pleasure of forwarding one to you.  But please read it as address to mechanics who have all to learn.
King will bring down the sword on the 5th of August, and what you sent with it I am expecting with a large package of books by the waggon.  
I trust your daughter was quite well when you heard from her and that if she and her husband ever feel inclined to travel towards this part of the world I shall be most happy to receive then as Goodrich Court.

I am very greatly obliged by the trouble you have been taking about the catalogues, and trust sooner or later your exertions will be crowned with success.  I fear your kindness induces you to speak too well of what I addressed to the mechanics, but it must always be borne in mind, that I had to speak to people but little informed.  This post ought to have conveyed to you a portion of my 2nd lecture but the editor of the Hereford Times has not sent me the right number.  I have however written to him, and as soon as I get it, will forward your copy.  Many thanks for your kind intention respecting the Medical Superstitions.  The book cannot fail to be interesting, if as well compsosed as your other works.  
I regret to hear of Mr Gurney's bad state of health, but as I know he is in good hands, am sure that all which science and skill can effect, he will have the good fortune to experience.

My dear Pettigrew
The only reason I did not transmit to you my approval of your reply was an idea that it would be surplusage, as every unprejudiced person must have regarded it as quite satisfactory.  I am delighted with the sentence p.g. beginning "It may be safe," but what most astonishes me is your praiseworthy conduct in being so temperate while so much is done to stimulate your anger.
I cannot be present at Winchester.  If I could for one day, I would for all.  The lecture on shipbuilding thought calculated for a Mechanics Institute would requite not only to be greatly simplified, but treated more scientifically when read to so learned a body as the British Archaeological Society.  For this I have not the time.  The Hon. G. Secretary of the Archaeological Society asked me last year to dress up the paper I sent to the Antiquaries, on alphabetical notation in music, for your last meeting at Canterbury.  
Had the Dean of Hereford kept his promise (a practice I never find him pursue) and given me tracings from a flyleaf to a book in the Cathedral library, I think with other memoranda, a curious dissertation might be written on that subject, but for all the renewed promises on this matter I have waited in vain.

I shall also send you Shaw's tracing & King's colouring of the painted slab you wished with a pencil tracing of the figure by the note to shew with how much more spirit and how far more artistically the original is.  There will be with it the ground plans and elevations of the ship temples, to which your artist must give effect and which must be numbered with corresponding references in the letter-press.  If I have time to make a reduced drawing of the Roman inscribed monumental stone with its specimen of military costume I will do so, as Mr. Roach Smith desired, if not the others must go without.

I ought in the first place to thank you most cordially for all the flattering encomiums you have been pleased, both in print and orally, to bestow on me in your addresses to the Archaeological Association; and next to thank you for the very friendly reception I invariably experience at your house.  My object in speaking to Mr Wright was to know whether my paper on the Llanvair rail which I had written to demonstrate its being alphabetic musical notation, was to be published in the account of the Gloucester Congress.  He said that he could not answer the question till there had been a meeting to determine the matter and that he would speak to you o the subject.  You will very greatly oblige me by the earliest information thereon, as should it be rejected, I must beg to have the paper and drawings returned as soon after as possible, because I should then read it at the congress of the Cambrian Archaeological Institute at Aberystwyth in the second week in September.  I would much rather both my communications appeared with your Association, but if that be inconvenient, I must send an early notice to the Cambrian secretary.  The country is looking most beautiful and I found quiet and dose of castor oil restore me to perfect health, which for wont of both I could not have in London.  
Pray remember me most kindly to Mrs Pettigrew and your charming family, and

Dear Sir,
I shall only say in answer to what you observe on the invention of my name, that you will see from the enclosed my wish that it shod remains set down for five copies.  On the subject of Walter Scott I think that he has considerable genius too much alloyed by taste; but I have never seen either genius or taste in the criticisms on poetry I have read in the Edinburgh Review; which seems quite at variance with Longinus on the pleasure derived from antientry (?).  They seem to wish the distinction of received opinions on poetry, without substituting new ones, or even explaining what they would have.  I congratulate you on the idea of Westminster Abbey as a subject of local poetry, & wonder I never thought of it, in reading Spectator, or Walker's St James's Park.  It is one indeed replete with sublimity; of which your plan, too, allows the full operation.  I did not think I should have had to quote in answer to you, as West did in answer to Gray "vive paulisper cum vivis" for I have lately upbraided a really old bard, Jerningham, for writing his Farewell, when he presented it to me.  I hope you will be the poet, if there is to be one, who will celebrate Stoke; as Dr Lyther who was meditating it, is dead, & cannot therefore prevent it from sharing his fate.  In the mean time, I trust we shall drink to the memory of Horace & Maecenas, writers of the old school, when their busts adorn my garden, opposite to each other, & breathe a wish for the restoration of pure taste, on perusing the immortal alcaics beneath them.

It seems to be obvious that in this country we are far behind in our acquaintance with our ancient Celtic coinage to what is the case in France [...] regard to the coinage of ancient Gaul.  The inquiries here instituted as to the origin of the cognate coinages of this and the neighbouring country may tend to direct our views as to the proper principles on which our ancient British coinage is to be considered and enable somewhat more definite views to be entertained on the rather obscure point of the period of its commencement and other particulars of interest.
Six wood cuts of coins and one plate will be required, the former will be from about 36s to two pounds as near as I can judge  The plate I will have engraved at my own expense.  The paper will occupy 14 or 15 pages of the Journal

My Dear Sir, 
Many thanks for your kind note accompanying your work on the Mummies of the ancient Egyptians, and which I will value not less for the interest of the subject on which it treats as from its being the gifted (?) of its talented author.
With regard to the subject on which we spoke the other evening I fear I did not sufficiently let you understand, how matters at present are - although nothing at present is definitely settled, yet a certain partie has already been spoke to on the subject, but who unfortunately has never had the advantage of seeing the country - but at the same time I am strongly inclined to think would forgo any claim he may have, were there a probability of Sir G.W. being likely to devote his talents and reputation to such an understanding - but whose own reputation stands sufficiently high both in literature and arts - as to be quite equal to the work.
Otherwise I need not say how much gratified I should have been to have benefited by your charming and extensive knowledge in all connected with that remarkable country.

All my invitations have been sent - and barely a refusal - 60 have already accepted - amongst whom are some very learned Egyptians - I hope you have invited Wilkinson - although I fear his health will scarce admit of his attending.
Believe me very

My dear sir,
I forgot my minute book last evening.
On my return home I found a note from Dunkin who states that he has persuaded Mr Creasy F.S.A. to go to Winchester on purpose to get us an account of the Cathedral, & that he is now actually there for that purpose.  Creasy I am told drew up the account for Britton's Cathedrals.  The programme is in press.  I worked two hours at it after my return this am.  
I have asked Nixon the sculptor to bring something to exhibit to morrow evening and also others.

Mr Way requested me to wait until Monday before I took steps to inform the Committee of this unlooked-for obstruction as he thought he could obtain for us leave to meet in the room of the Society of Literature; but I have not yet heard from him.  We also spoke of your kindness in offering us the use of one of your rooms.  I am however up to the present moment uninformed of Mr Way's views, and shall be obliged by your giving me your opinion in this emergency that I may have time to send letters to the various members of the Committee.

My dear Sir
In consequence of your intimation that I might give the ticket you were so good as to forward me to a friend in spite of the "not transferable" on its face, I have sent it to the Revd. Geo. Wallace, headmaster of the King's School, Canterbury.  I have been unequal to my previous exertions ever since my last visit to East Kent, on my way thither, at Mr Darrell's at Calehill, I had a violent attack of Cholera, and was forced to spare myself when under other hospitable roofs.  I continued to exert myself, however until on 9th June 1843, when I had a paralytic stroke, & since when, good spirits are almost the only sign of my former self remaining.  Whilst I live, however, I shall take an interest in antiquarian researches, and be happy if my stores can be made useful to others.  They are ample, in the medieval period of our County History.  
My friend Lambert Larking will probably be pleased with an opportunity of referring to a letter, in the Chapter Library, from a vicar written to a Prior of Xtr Chh. of which I made an imperfect copy, upon which we tried our skill together.
He has himself no common skill in decyphering old writing, but if a fee will obtain more competent assistance, beg him to advance it on my account.  I presume the association have secured access to the Chapter Library.  It was kindly accorded to myself by Dr Spry.
On the Eastern side of the cloisters is a figure, commonly pointed out as Prior Chillenden.  There is a legend round it, of which sufficient remains legible to show it to be "Frater John "Schepuys(?)".  
On the south side of the cloisters, the tale of the fox (or wolf) and the geese, is given on a succession of bosses, on the last of which, the cloister has vented its satire and I think it is worth observing, though it might escape if you were not awake to it.
I had occasion to fall so foul of Mr Willement, that several of my friends have expressed their regret, but I must call attention to other instances of his misrepresentation, that I have not already brought forward, that will justify me.  His No. 737, which he calls a lyon salient on a throne, will be seen to be a lyon breaking out of a cage; and his Number 242, & 259, to be very incorrectly blazoned.  But my pen and my hand fail me, and it is well, as few attach the importance to heraldry that I do.  
Respectfully,
Though with a weary hand,

I believe the stone has been altered since my copies were taken from it: therefore, if you require other for the journal, the plan will require lithographing afresh.  You would be better able to get the plan done in London than it could be executed here, and cheaper too.

In such a case as Mr Isaacson, [my Co] my editorial duties must be merely to see the MS through the press: I may not add, nor take away.  What I should propose is, that each author condense his own paper: for it is an awkward matter to shorten the noses of other people's children.  The 3 papers you have confided to me number 50 sides of MS: the quantity of type that will occupy depends upon the style of writing: I should say about 40 pages: if so, they are scarcely more than may fairly be set up verbatim.  
All prosperities to you & yours.  If ever you want to see me about the Volume, or anything else, I will if you send me times, call on you when in your morning gown.  Our kind regards to Mrs Pettigrew & you ??? & I am,

Dear Sir,
I received your note yesterday, and in reply beg to send a printed copy of the little essay on the kind of which you make such use as may be convenient.  It purports to have been printed along with the Met. Literary Journal, but such was not the case on account of a delay at the printers and there are not ten copies of it circulating - these being among friends in the North of England.  I am not surprised at the difficulty in establishing a Medical Journal, and it was from a knowledge of such difficulty that I ventured to propose the propriety of the medical profession in the various provincial towns being canvassed in the way of business, so that a valuable property might in a few weeks be made of it, when as under other circumstances, it too often happens that great costs are incurred.  I have not seen the work advertised - if you wish it & will send it, I think I could take upon my to say that I would have the prospectus in the Conser. Journal, at one third the price.  We circulate several thousands.  
I am sorry to say I have not by me the cowardly and abject apology of the Rev. Mr Worthington.  I do not know that there one person living whom I more thoroughly despise than this man.  I consider him a mean and dastardly calumniator, and totally worthless as an individual.  His public conduct is everywhere offensive, and I noticed him figuring very discreditably the other day at the Mansion House, when he was called to order by the Lord Mayor.  His officiousness in joining the Committee of a public newspaper is extremely reprehensible, and I am not sure that both his conduct and that of another clergyman on the same committee ought not to be laid before the Bishop of the Diocese.  I have read the joint stock reply, which the Charing Cross people have made to your charges.  It is really as a composition below contempt, and I find that the refutations are chiefly supported by one another.  The testimonials of Dr this & Dr that is really too absurd - and only worthy of the invention of Patent Medicines, Rowlands' Macassar, or Warren's Blacking.  The hospital has certainly got a blow from which nothing but sound and allied management can recover it.  I met Dr Golding yesterday in Hyde Park.  He looked lonely and melancholy - had  on a "shocking bad hat" and was very ill drest.  Being near the Serpentine, I had serious fears he might be meditating self destruction, and watched him for some time, til he took the direction of the pond near Kensington Palace.  I sincerely trust his friends have heard of him.
In haste I am dear sir

Winchester, Aug 1, 1845
My dear Pettigrew,
I drop you a line to let you know how we are going on.  We are three at the White Hart, Waller, his friend Claxton (I think that is his name) and myself.  Waller and Claxton are drawing the paintings in the Cathedral.  The only ecclesiastic that I hear of as being here at present is Dr Dealty the senior prebend, who has power over the Cathedral, and who (Bradfield thinks) will come with us.  We have traced through the verger all sorts of people of the other side who have been at the Cathedral.  De Cauis??? (also in Parker's draught) has been drawing the paintings, so that he will be forestalled by Waller.  
The mayor asks in a very friendly manner after you.  He appears to be perfectly zealous on our side, and the town as I understand it pretty generally with us.  Bradfield thinks that we shall have not less that fifty persons in the town and neighbourhood taking tickets.  The archives, which I looked at on Wednesday, are very poor, and they are shy of letting us look at them - but I shall get as much as I want, I have found by accident that Way has tricked the town clerk and I learn that Bruce/Buye has told them if I go in they must take care to have somebody to watch me - they are sadly afraid I shall set the town on fire.  I see the town clerk has been talked to - he is but a simple person, and I laughed him out of it.  I have selected some documents which he is to take to his office, and I am to go and work at them this morning.  
I was at Southampton yesterday, where I found people in a much higher degree of Civilization.  Everybody seemed to strive to excell the other in pleasing me.  The mayor had had a resolution passed in the town council the day before that I should do what I liked with their archives, and, he being obliged to go to Brighton when he is [...]for his wife's health, he left special orders to pay attention to me.  The town clerk also was ill, but he sent one of his clerks to stay with me all the day, and Allenby the banker invited me to dinner.  I am going again on Saturday.  The archives there are extremely valuable and very well kept.  I should not have been able to make a paper worth a fig of a report on these at Winchester, but the Southampton ones will set me up.  The worst is, I am forced to go over them very hastily.  I found that even at Southampton the enemy had been making at attempt to forestall me.  They had no influence with the authorities to hinder me.  But there was a gentleman who had belonged to the old corporation, who was pretty well acquainted with the records, and who came to give me any assistance he could in a very friendly manner.  In the middle of talking he said, "There is a friend of mine in London, Mr Vaux, who has written to me to request I would give him any extracts I can from the Southampton records for a paper at the meeting at Winchester" I said, "of course you know that your friend Mr Vaux is on the other side".  He answered, "O yes, but I suppose you have all the same object and I will give any help I can to either."  They will not get much help out of him.  But what apes they are to try and imitate our papers, coming after us!  It shows they are taken hard up for subjects.  I hear that Way has applied to a farmer about 5 miles off who is said to have some barrows on his ground.  I have sent a joke on the subject to the Literary Gazette, but I don't know if Jerdan will put it in.
I see that we shall have as full access to the Cathedral and every other place here as we had at Canterbury, and I don't see the least harm or hindrance that can come from the dean and chapter being on the other side.  I look for Smith, Croker, and Fairholt today.  I unfortunately forgot to bring three of four tickets I had, but I suppose Smith will have plenty.  Halliwell will be here tomorrow.  The Winchester Chronicle of last Saturday has made a very curious blunder.  In one column they have inserted our advertisement, and in the another Parker's advertisement of the Journal no. VI and of Willis' Canterbury Cathedral; but in the latter, where Parker had put an announcement of their meeting in September in large letters, the printer, I suppose thinking it was a mistake, has altered it to "this association will hold its second annual congress at Winchester in the week commencing August 4"!!  So that they have advertised our meeting!  I supposed a man may take a little boy instead of a lady with his ticket - I have stated so here, because one gentleman has his wife too ill to go, but would like to take his boy.  
I don't know if you will read my scribbling, for I am writing before breakfast, and very hungry

I wrote to Lord Mahon this morning, so that that matter is settled, and I feel quite a load taken off my mind.  I shall now go to work on our own archaeological matters with more alacrity than ever.  
I had made a mistake about the Council meeting today.  I had the impression that there was none this week, till I received a note from Smith about an hour ago, in which he said he was starting to the meetg. of council.  Had I known before, I would have come.  
I had like to have come to disturb you last night; though I don't know if you would have liked it had it been late.  Mr Guizot's mother was taken unwell yesterday - she is very old, and the trouble of the late events, with change of climate, &c have had their effect upon her.  Mr Guizot sent to me last night that Dr Holland had visited her in the morning, but that he wished much to know if there were anybody [...] to call in immediately if she were ill in the night.  I got him the name of a person here but I told him I believed my friend Mr Pettigrew to be one of the most distinguished in London, and if he would call me up, I thought I could fetch you in little more than half an hour.  I don't know whether I was doing right or not - but today Madame Guizot is better.  I have not a notion where Dr Holland lives.
